## Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF) Implementation

### WBF Algorithm Overview

Our WBF implementation combines predictions from all 4 models using a sophisticated multi-stage process:

#### Stage 1: Detection Normalization
```python
def normalize_detections_from_all_models(self, main_analysis, model2_analysis, model3_analysis, model4_analysis):
    """
    Standardizes detection formats from all models into unified format:
    {
        'bbox': [x1, y1, x2, y2],
        'class': str,
        'confidence': float,
        'source_model': str
    }
    """
```

#### Stage 2: Cross-Model Clustering
```python
def cross_model_clustering(self, normalized_detections, eps=50.0, min_samples=1):
    """
    Groups overlapping detections using DBSCAN clustering:
    - Spatial clustering based on bounding box centers
    - IoU refinement for better grouping (threshold: 0.3)
    - Handles noise points as individual clusters
    """
```

#### Stage 3: Unified Bounding Box Creation
```python
def create_unified_bounding_boxes(self, normalized_detections, clusters, img_width, img_height):
    """
    Creates unified detections from clusters:
    - Minimum bounding rectangle calculation
    - Weighted confidence aggregation
    - Source model tracking
    - Severity assessment
    """
```

### Ensemble Logic Flow

#### 1. Model Weight Application
```python
self.model_weights = {
    'main_model': 0.30,    # YOLOv8s - Multi-class defect detection
    'model2': 0.20,        # Specialized defect detection
    'model3': 0.25,        # Has 'good_condition' class - special handling
    'model4': 0.25         # Advanced defect detection - increased for scratch detection
}
```

#### 2. Confidence Thresholding
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Each model has optimized confidence thresholds
- **Model 3 Special Handling**: Lower threshold (0.25) for better sensitivity
- **Ensemble Confidence**: Minimum 0.55 for final detection inclusion

#### 3. Class Priority System
```python
def apply_class_priority_ensemble(self, aggregated_classes):
    """
    Implements hierarchical class priority:
    1. 'good_condition' overrides 'scratch' detections
    2. Higher severity classes take precedence
    3. Model agreement weighting
    """
```

#### 4. Conflict Resolution
- **Model 3 Override**: "good_condition" detections can override damage predictions
- **Spatial Conflict Resolution**: IoU-based conflict detection and resolution
- **Confidence Weighting**: Higher confidence detections take precedence
