### Model Training Pipeline

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
```python
# Image preprocessing steps
- Resize to 640x640 pixels
- Normalize pixel values [0, 1]
- Apply data augmentation
- Convert to tensor format
```

#### 2. Model Configuration
- **Base Model**: YOLOv8s (Small variant for optimal speed/accuracy balance)
- **Input Resolution**: 640x640 pixels
- **Batch Size**: 16

```

### Damage Classes

Our system detects the following damage types:

| Class | Description | Severity Levels |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Dent** | Surface depressions and impacts | Slight, Moderate, Severe |
| **Scratch** | Surface abrasions and paint damage | Slight, Moderate, Severe |
| **Damage** | General structural damage | Moderate, Severe |
| **Severe Damage** | Critical structural damage | Severe |

*Note: Tire and other non-critical detections are filtered out in production for cleaner results.*

## Detection Workflow

### 1. Image Preprocessing
```python
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Load and resize image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (640, 640))
    
    # Normalize and convert to tensor
    image = image / 255.0
    return torch.tensor(image).permute(2, 0, 1)
```

### 2. Model Inference
```python
def predict_damage(model, image_tensor):
    with torch.no_grad():
        predictions = model(image_tensor)
    return predictions
```

### 3. Post-Processing Pipeline

#### Defect Grouping Algorithm
1. **Spatial Clustering**: Group nearby detections using distance-based clustering
2. **Class Consistency**: Ensure grouped detections have compatible damage types
3. **Confidence Weighting**: Weight group confidence by individual detection scores
4. **Severity Assessment**: Determine overall severity based on damage extent and type

#### Condition Assessment
```python
def assess_overall_condition(defect_groups):
    if not defect_groups:
        return "Excellent"
    
    severe_count = sum(1 for group in defect_groups if group.severity == "severe")
    total_damage_area = sum(group.total_area for group in defect_groups)
    
    if severe_count > 0 or total_damage_area > 50000:
        return "Poor"
    elif len(defect_groups) > 3 or total_damage_area > 20000:
        return "Fair"
    else:
        return "Good"
```
