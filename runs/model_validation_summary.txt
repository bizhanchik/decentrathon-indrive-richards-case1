Key Findings:
=============

✅ YOLOv8s demonstrates the best overall performance across all metrics
✅ Model2 shows strong performance with 6-class classification
⚠️  Model3 has lower performance, likely due to dataset characteristics
⚠️  Model4 shows good precision but lower recall

Recommendations:
===============

1. Use YOLOv8s for production deployment (highest mAP@50)
2. Consider Model2 as alternative for 6-class specific tasks
3. Review Model3 dataset quality and training parameters
4. Optimize Model4 for better recall performance
